# Proximity Hover 

This was my attempt to reverse engineer the pocketbase gopher (check it out here: https://pocketbase.io). Its an image who's eyes follow the mouse around the webpage. 

I recreated the effect with an image of Morty, who's expression matches mine when I first visited Pocketbase's website (do give it a look)
